\maketitle

\paragraph{Method}
Here the learning rate of the \texttt{sgd\_env} is dynamically adapted with a learned
Reinforcement Learning agent.
The assumption is that the state and the reward are expressive enough to guide an RL agent
to learn how to adapt the learning rate.

The learning rate $\gamma \in [0.00001, 1]$ is adjusted in the log-space.
We used a SAC~\cite{haarnoja-icml2018} agent from the library \texttt{stable-baselines3}~\cite{stable-baselines3}
and trained it for $1000000$ steps.
For training we used $n_{instances} = 1000$ and a policy architecture of two hidden layers
with $64$ neurons each.
We switch the instance each reset in a round-robin manner.

\paragraph{Limitations}
There are few possible limitations.
First, no hyperparameters are tuned which means that the selected agent might perform better.
Second, no information about instances is leveraged during training making the agent oblivious of the cMDP.
For example, instance features could be included in the state or be used to build a curriculum.
Third, the state is a simple concatenation of the observation dictionary content.
The state features do not necessarily lie on the same scale, maybe they can be scaled to the unit interval or
preprocessed and/or condensed in any other way.

\paragraph{Reproducibility}
We provide the code and the command to reproduce the model in \texttt{README.md}.
The training took approximately $3.5$ hours on an Intel Core i9-9900K CPU with 16 cores.

\paragraph{Hyperparameters}
This method introduces the type of RL agent and its hyperparameters.
The RL agent type was manually set, and the default hyperparameters are used.
